# Decision Tree Classifier on Social Network Ads Data

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier to predict user purchase behavior based on Age and Estimated Salary using the "Social Network Ads" dataset.

## Overview

The notebook covers the following steps:
- Data loading and exploration.
- Feature selection and target variable identification.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.
- Training the Decision Tree Classifier with the entropy criterion.
- Evaluating model performance using confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Visualization of the confusion matrix and decision tree.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn

## How to Run

1. Install the required libraries using:
